## Executive Summary
This Business Requirements Document (BRD) outlines the detailed requirements for an Inventory Management System designed to integrate with an existing electronic procurement system. The solution will streamline the order process from initial request through completion while providing comprehensive tracking, reporting, and management capabilities.

## Business Objectives
1. Create a robust inventory management system that tracks orders from placement to completion
2. Improve visibility on order status, component details, and financial information
3. Standardize the procurement workflow with defined order stages
4. Provide detailed reporting and analytics capabilities
5. Ensure compliance with organizational purchasing policies
6. Reduce manual processes in procurement workflow
7. Enable effective tracking of invoices against orders
